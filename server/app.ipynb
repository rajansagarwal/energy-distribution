      "\u001b[33mDEPRECATION: textract 1.6.5 has a non-standard dependency specifier extract-msg<=0.29.*. pip 24.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of textract or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers.
